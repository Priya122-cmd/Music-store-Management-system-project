🎵 Music Store Management System – Data Analysis using MySQL

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a Music Store Management System using MySQL to gain insights into customer purchasing behavior, genre popularity, artist performance, and regional sales trends.
The project demonstrates how structured relational databases and SQL queries can be used to transform raw transactional data into meaningful business intelligence.

🎯 Problem Statement

Music stores often struggle to understand:
	•	Customer purchasing patterns
	•	Popular music genres and top-performing artists
	•	High-revenue regions and cities
Raw transactional data alone is not sufficient for effective decision-making. The challenge was to design a normalized relational database and extract actionable insights using SQL.

🥅 Project Goals
	•	Design a normalized relational database for a music store
	•	Analyze customer spending and purchase behavior
	•	Identify top genres, artists, and high-revenue regions
	•	Support data-driven business decisions using SQL

  🗂️ Database Objects Used
📊 Tables
	•	Genre
	•	MediaType
	•	Artist
	•	Album
	•	Track
	•	Customer
	•	Employee
	•	Invoice
	•	InvoiceLine
	•	Playlist
	•	PlaylistTrack
🔑 Database Design Features
	•	Primary Keys and Foreign Keys
	•	Cascading updates and deletes

🛠️ SQL Concepts & Techniques
	•	Complex JOINs
	•	Subqueries
	•	Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
	•	Aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG)
	•	Grouping and sorting for analysis

  🔍 Insights & Observations
	•	Rock music emerged as one of the most purchased genres across multiple countries
	•	Certain cities generated significantly higher revenue, making them suitable for promotional events
	•	A small segment of customers contributed a disproportionately high share of total sales
	•	Specific artists dominated Rock music production based on track count
	•	Tracks longer than the average duration formed a distinct segment useful for playlist analysis
	•	Genre popularity and top-spending customers varied by country, highlighting regional preferences

  💡 Conclusion & Recommendations

Music stores can optimize revenue by:
	•	Promoting top-performing genres and artists in high-revenue regions
	•	Targeting high-value customers with personalized offers
SQL-driven analysis provides a strong foundation for informed and strategic business decisions.

🧰 Tools Used
